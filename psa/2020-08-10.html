    UGWA now has the proper alternate schedule on the first day of school, in
    addition to a few other changes.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Wednesday SELF has been replaced with Gunn Together, where you meet with
        your teachers from Periods 1 through 7 (they cycle through each period
        every week). Currently, the first week's Gunn Together is with Period 5,
        then the second week and onwards cycles starting from Period 1, but I
        might have guessed wrong.
    </li>
    <li>
        SELF has taken over the school, so the option to hide SELF has been
        removed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Period 8 has been added to the schedule. You can hide it in the Options.
        Editing period H times has been removed.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Side note: It's possible the school no longer uses their Google Calendar to
    post alternate schedules ;-;.
